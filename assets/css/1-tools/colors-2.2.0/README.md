## Better colors for the web.

## What is this?

A simple color palette for the web. Let's be honest, out of the box, the color strings that css provides aren't... the tops.
This is a set of sass/less/stylus/css variables and css classes that can help fix that with just 647B of minified and gzipped css.

(Uncompressed is just 888B)

colors.css provides utilities to apply backgrounds, text-color, border colors for both html and svg elements.

# Example

```scss
.blue {         color: $blue; }
.bg-blue {      background-color: $blue; }
.border--blue { border-color: $blue; }
.fill-blue {    fill: $blue; }
.stroke-blue {  stroke: $blue; }
```

## Install colors.css

You can get the code a few different ways

Download a zip from this page

Clone / fork the repo through git
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/colors.git
```

Install [through npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/colors.css)
```bash
npm install --save-dev colors.css
```

Install the [ruby gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/clrs)
```
gem install clrs
```

### Using the css
Simply copy colors.css to your css directory and include the file like so in the head of your html document

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/colors.css">
```

### Using sass, stylus, less, and myth

If you'd like to customize colors.css to your liking, you can edit the source in a variety of flavors.
Colors uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com "GulpJs - A sweet js taskrunner") as a taskrunner.
There are individual gulp tasks for each preprocessor*
Each gulp task also comes with automatic vendor prefix support, csslint output, and livereload updates
built in.
It's pretty sweet.

First run

```bash
npm install -g gulp
```

Then

```bash
npm install
```

Once that is complete you can use any preprocessor like so

Recompile everything imported in ./sass/colors.scss to css/colors.css
everytime a file in the ./sass directory is updated
```bash
gulp sass
```

Recompile everything imported in ./stylus/colors.styl to ./css/colors.css
everytime a file in the ./stylus directory is updated
```bash
gulp stylus
```

Recompile myth/colors.css to css/colors.css everytime myth/colors.css is updated
```bash
gulp myth
```

If you would like to minify ./css/colors.css to .css/colors.min.css you can just run
```bash
gulp minify
```

* Except for less which doesn't seem well supported with gulp yet. Hopefully we can
better support less soon.
